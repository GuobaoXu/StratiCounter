% Selecting a good pixel for ending the current batch. Successive batches 
% are slightly overlapping with a maximum overlap section depending on the 
% value of Model.batchOverlap (measured in mean layer thicknesses). In this 
% way, any fuzzy annual layering in the last part of the batch is 
% determined also based on subsequent data. 
% tau is selected as the first pixel after a very likely layer boundary, 
% for which we are sure to be out of the previous layer. 
% Furthermore is calculated the probability of where ends the last layer 
% before the one in pixel tau (postau).

% 2015-10-15 16:24: Added calculation of postau

%% Selecting a pixel with no/little probability of being a layer boundary, 
% located right after a very accurately positioned layer boundary.
% Mean, min, and maximum layer thickness in pixels: 
dmean = meanLambda/Model.dx;
dmin = min(d);
dmax = max(d);

% Pixels with a high value of eta_all is indicative of a very accurately 
% positioned layer boundary:
eta_all = sum(FBprob.eta_bar,2);

% Find the pixel with maximum layer ending probability within the selected
% last part of the batch:
tstart = max(1,batchLength-round(Model.batchOverlap*dmean)-dmax);
tend = batchLength-dmax; 
% Find peak locations:
[peakvalue, ipeak] = findpeaks(eta_all(tstart:tend),'minpeakdistance',dmin);
% The maximum peak:
[~, ipeakmax] = max(peakvalue);
tmax = ipeak(ipeakmax)+tstart-1; % [pixel]
% And the subsequent peak: 
if ipeakmax < length(peakvalue)
    tnext = ipeak(ipeakmax+1)+tstart-1; % [pixel]
else
    [~, ipeak] = findpeaks(eta_all(tend+1:end),'minpeakdistance',dmin);
    tnext = ipeak(1)+tend;
end

% We want to pick the first pixel between these two peaks, having (almost) 
% no probability of being a layer boundary:
zerolimit = 10^-3;
tau = find(eta_all(tmax:tnext)<zerolimit,1,'first')+tmax-1;

% Or, if that is not possible, use the best possible location:
if isempty(tau)
    [~, itau] = min(eta_all(tmax:tnext));
    tau = itau+tmax-1; % [pixel]
end
