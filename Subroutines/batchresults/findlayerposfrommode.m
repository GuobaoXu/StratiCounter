%% [layerpos, layerpos_issues] = findlayerposfrommode(modevalue)
% Finding the maximum likelihood layer positions based on the
% Forward-Backward algorithm layer-number distributions. 
% Given that the layer probability distributions are based on the MAP 
% criterion, we may have a jump of multiple years occuring in a pixel, and 
% similarly it may happen that we go back to a previous layer (the two 
% events often co-occur). In these cases, we try to resolve the issue as
% "intuitively" as possible; layerpos will contain the best set of 
% boundaries (all corresponding to 1 yr), and layer-positions with issues
% are provided separately thus allowing for manual check-up. 
% Layer positions are given as located midway between datapoints belonging 
% to the two layers.

%% Find locations with a change in ML layer number:
% Jumps occurring in modevalue:

existingjumps = existingjumps(existingjumps~=0);
if isempty(existingjumps); 
    layerpos = []; layerpos_issues = [];

if ~isempty(layerpos)
    [layerpos, index] = sortrows(layerpos,1);
    jumpvalue = jumpvalue(index);
end

% The layer boundary is taken as located midway between data corresponding 
% to the two layers (i.e. is located between two pixels):

% The problematic jumps where the jumpvalue is not equal to +/-1 (value 
% depends on the applied age unit). 
normaljump = mode(jumpvalue);
index = find(jumpvalue'~=normaljump);

% or right after a jump of opposite sign to normaljump. We select the one(s)
% closest to any negative jump (if such exists).

    % Extending layerposition to avoid problems with margins:

    % layer boundary above):

    % actually ought to be counted as 2 or more layers, but we don't know 
    % where to add the extra layer(s)).
